/** ExampleView Object constructor
 * 
 * This object represents the code for one specific view (in this case the Example view). 
 * 
 * It is responsible for:
 * - constructing the view (e.g. if you need to create some HTML elements procedurally) 
 * - populating the view with the data
 * - updating the view when the data changes
 * 
 * You should create a view Object like this for every view in your UI.
 * 
 * @param {jQuery object} container - references the HTML parent element that contains the view.
 * @param {Object} model - the reference to the Dinner Model
 */ 
var ExampleView = function (container, model) {
	
	/**
	 * We use the @method find() on @var {jQuery object} container to look for various elements 
	 * inside the view in orther to use them later on. For instance:
	 * 
	 * @var {jQuery object} numberOfGuests is a reference to the <span> element that 
	 * represents the placeholder for where we want to show the number of guests. It's
	 * a reference to HTML element (wrapped in jQuery object for added benefit of jQuery methods)
	 * and we can use it to modify <span>, for example to populate it with dynamic data (for now 
	 * only 'Hello world', but you should change this by end of Lab 1).
	 * 
	 * We use variables when we want to make the reference private (only available within) the
	 * ExampleView.
	 * 
	 * IMPORTANT: Never use $('someSelector') directly in the views. Always use container.find
	 * or some other way of searching only among the containers child elements. In this way you
	 * make your view code modular and ensure it dosn't break if by mistake somebody else
	 * in some other view gives the same ID to another element.

	 * should not be assigned in the view, but rather in controller.
	 * 
	 * We can then, in some other code, use exampleView.plusButton to reference the 
	 * this button and do something with it (see Lab 2).
